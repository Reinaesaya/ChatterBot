# OUIRL-ChatBot

The OUIRL (Osaka University Intelligent Robotics Laboratory) ChatBot is an experimental fork upon this [ChatterBot](https://github.com/gunthercox/ChatterBot). Additions upon the original API include adding adapters for various online chatterbots, and trial implementation of visual stimuli through image/video captioning for conversation manipulation.

Please refer to the original Github repo for setup procedures, though simple cloning on repository and execution of following command should be sufficient: 

```
python setup.py install
```

To run terminal-based module, simply run:

```
python TatoraChat.py
```
